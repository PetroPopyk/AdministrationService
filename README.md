# AdministrationService
The task was to create a online administrarion service that allows to users to interact with databases in MySql. Also needed to create a roles differentiation that enables/disables some functions depending on users rights. Site was written on AngularJs + NodeJs. All parts of projects i wrote by myself.At present time i work on some additional functions of the service and adaptivity, but in generally it is ready for usage.
